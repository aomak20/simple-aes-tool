# Simple AES Tool v1.0

## About
A simple CLI tool for performing AES encryption/decryption on files in a variety of modes. This is just a personal project made to enhance my understanding of cryptography and get some practice with C. It is not intended for any serious cryptographic applications, such as the handling of sensitive data.

This project is still a work in progress so some features may not yet be available (e.g. modes besides ECB, initialization vectors, etc.)
